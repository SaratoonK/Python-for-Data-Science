# Python for DSAI

This is the repository for the course Python for DSAI at Asian Institute of Technology.

Some resource worth mentioning:

1. Prerequisites/0 - Reading Roadmap
  - For those who wants to know what papers to read.  I have listed ONLY the most important papers you need to read in the field of machine learning
2. Prerequisities/0 - Installation
  - For setting up tools for the course
3. Prerequisities/0 - Course Notations
  - Understanding notations is the first step towards conquering math, so take a look and familiarized with it
4. Syllabus/0. Course Introduction.ipynb
  - Contains how I run the course.  This course is a 15 weeks course, each week having two labs of 3 hours each.  Each lab always end with the assessment and solution.
  
5. I have put many folder titled "further-study" or "exercise".  These resources are especially aimed for those who have completed the basic materials of the course, and would like to further improve your knowledge.  The only reason I could not teach is due to time constraint of the course.
  
I would also like to give credits to several githubs that I have revised to create this:

- https://github.com/SethHWeidman/DLFS_code
- https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook
- Awesome datacamp on PyTorch by Jose Marcial Portilla
- Many other awesome github heros (that I forget to reference...)

I would also like to thank students who have contributed:

- Akraradet Sinsamersuk
- Pranisaa Charnparttarvanit
- Chanapa Pananookooln

The course is structured into 3 big components, mostly focusing on preprocessing and modeling perspectives:

### 1. Bootcamp: Python Basics
Focus on getting started.
  - Docker
  - Variables
  - List
  - Tuples, Dictionaries
  - Functions
  - Classes
  - Exception

### 2. Data Science
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Sklearn
  
### 3. Machine Learning from Scratch
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes 

### 4. Signal Processing
- Theories and preprocessing

### 5. Deep Learning
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Convolutional Neural Network
  - Long Short-Term Memory
  
### Appendix -  Deployment 
  - FastAPI + Docker
  - Heroku + Github Actions
  - Prometheus + Grafana
  - AWS EC2

### Appendix - Organization
  - How to organize your ML project folders
